              After coming back from teaching a JavaScript workshop, I felt
              inspired to create something just for fun. I realized that of all
              the placeholder text/lorem ipsum generators available, there was
              nothing for HBO’s The Wire fans. Generate some content for your
              projects today. (Warning: Contains explicit language.)
